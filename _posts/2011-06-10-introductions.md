Hello,
My name is Isaac Sanders and I was a High School Junior until 3:00 last Monday.
I have since joined EdgeCase, a company of "Software Artisans" as the newest
apprentice. I am working with Joe O'Brien, co-founder and CEO. I am learning
the craft of code and picking up gems of wisdom related to starting and running
a successful business. The past few days have been absolutely surreal. I hope
that I can come out of this being able to say that I am on my way to becoming
a master, as Joe and so many others I have met are, of code and development. I
hope to one day look back on this first blog post in X years and pay it forward
to my own apprentice.

Most of my posts for the first leg of my journey will be regarding the book
Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye. I will leave bits
of wisdom I pick up on my twitter account (@isaacsanders) and continue to talk
about things I learn, people I meet, and code I write. I will reflect on
everything, and hopefully my readers learn from my experiences and grow in turn.

Best Wishes,

Isaac
