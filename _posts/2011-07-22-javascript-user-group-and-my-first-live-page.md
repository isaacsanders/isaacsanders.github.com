I went to my first Columbus JavaScript User Group
([@cbusjs](http://twitter.com/cbusjs "Columbus JavaScript User's Group Twitter"))
this past Wednesday. There were a few talks, but one really
interested me. The talk that interested me was one on Node.js and
Express, a Sinatra-like framework for Node. I had only glanced
previously, but this really encouraged me to move forward and work
on something. And as it happens... I needed a place to put my
resume information without crowding business cards, and I wanted to
code it myself, so I created a small node.js "app" that I will be
adding functionality to over the weekend. It also gave me the
opportunity to try writing my own HAML(Jade in Express)/SASS. Right
now it is purely HAML/SASS, but I want to write jQuery for it to
add content regarding the topics I included. If you want to take a
look it is hosted [here](http://bit.ly/PersonalCV "Personal CV") on
heroku. The source is on Github
[here](http://github.com/daedalus96/personalcv "Source for PersonalCV").
Please leave constructive advice/feedback.
