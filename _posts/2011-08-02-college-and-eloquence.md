This past weekend I went on a trip with my family to check out
colleges. We went to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, in Terre
Haute, IN and University of Illinois, in Champaign, IL. I enjoyed
both schools, but was able to walk away realizing a few things.

- I want to go to a big school. Having a lot of people allows me
  to make my own community and it will be more likely that there are
  people with my same interests. It is also easier to be anonymous
  with 40,000 other students walking around. I like the freedom to be
  as visible as I want.
- I want a school with people a lot smarter than I am. On Sunday,
  I "got lost" on the UIUC campus, and ambushed a few CS
  students/faculty. I met Sariel Har-Peled, an Associate Professor in
  the department, and he told me something memorable. He said, when
  speaking of what kind of school I should be looking for, that "it
  is better to the tail of the lions, then to be the head of the
  wolves."
- I would like to do research as an undergraduate. Being able to
  work on the cutting edge sounds like a once in a lifetime
  experience, and going to a strong research university would enable
  me to do just that.
- I want a university that has support for open source. I really
  and truly believe in open source's ability to accomplish anything
  and couldn't see myself somewhere that was not supportive of open
  source.

After realizing these few things, I have a renewed enthusiasm for
my college search. I can't wait for my last trip, which will be
next week, and we are going to Carnegie Mellon University, in
Pittsburgh, PA. I hope that any advice that you all have you will
share with me beforehand.

While I was on this trip this weekend, I finished one of the best
technical books that I have ever read. Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen
([@russolsen](http://twitter.com/russolsen "Russ Olsen's Twitter"))
is simply the fullest and most interesting Ruby book that I have
read. From the chapters about iterators, to the benefits of an
External DSL, it is a wonderfully educating read. Russ is funny and
wise in every chapter. I will be referring to it for a long time to
come, due to the wealth of insight that it has. I would suggest it
to anyone who is learning Ruby. The next book I will be reading is
Design Patterns in Ruby, another book by Russ Olsen, and I am sure
that it will be just as useful.

Cheers,

Isaac
