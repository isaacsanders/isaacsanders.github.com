I might sound like a
fanboy, but having just finished Design Patterns in Ruby by
*Russ Olsen*, I would be remiss if I were to not say how awesome
this book is. I didn't know what the GoF design patterns were, but
this book gave a an awesome introduction to over half of the
original patterns, and a couple that are Ruby specific. When you
read Design Patterns in Ruby and Eloquent Ruby, you feel like Russ
is a teacher, and you are having a conversation with him. The
subtle humor and the stories of his youth remind me a lot of some
of my high school teachers. The information inside is both clear
and concise, with plenty of code examples. Having read the two
(books) in the order that I did, I can see the ideas explained in
Eloquent Ruby formulating in the author's head in Design Patterns.
I would suggest these books to anyone who wants to get started in
Ruby and already has a firm base with programming, as they are not
beginner's books.
