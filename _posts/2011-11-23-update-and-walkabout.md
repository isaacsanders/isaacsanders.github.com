title: Update and Walkabout

It has been some time
since I last posted. I have had a lot of wonderful things happen,
and many more are on the horizon.

Since mid-September, I have been
working at 2Checkout.com in Columbus, OH. 2Checkout is a hosted
payment processing provider whose mission is to help sellers sell
more. In my time there, I have enjoyed building relationships with
my coworkers and working on various projects.

Outside of work I
have been busy, as well. I wrote and released a RubyGem called
ReUser. I have presented at the Columbus Ruby Brigade for the past
three months, on various tools, such as Vagrant, Guard, and my
baby, ReUser. In addition, I have been attending the Ohio State
University and applying to multiple schools. I am having a busy
senior year.

However, there is something very exciting on the
horizon for me. My high school is not a normal high school. I go to
an alternative school where the philosophy is based on teaching by
giving the students responsibility and by giving them experiences
outside the classroom. Every year, students plan and execute a
experiential learning opportunity. In my senior year, this
opportunity is manifested as Walkabout.

Walkabout is a tradition at
my school based on the Aboriginal rite of passage of the same name.
Walkabout consists of two eight-week periods, where I find a mentor
and work for the mentor, trading service for learning.

Walkabout is
a time for reflecting and self-discovery. My goals for Walkabout,
beyond those of learning from my mentor, are to become a more
social person, to begin to learn to care for myself, and to budget
my time and money better.

During Walkabout, people do not always
stay in Columbus. I am planning my Walkabouts, but finding housing
is something that will be difficult. This is why I would ask that
anyone who would be willing to let me stay with them for either of
these two Walkabouts to please contact me. You may contact me at
