title: Sorry for the Mess
---

I hope you all don't mind the mess. I am doing some construction/renovation.

Let me give you the quick breakdown of my plans for this space.

On the front page, I think I like the content, but will be styling it a little differently.

The blog will be a place for thoughts I have, and reflections of mine, so keep watch.
I may decide to add an RSS feed or something depending on the feedback.
I <del>will try to incorporate something like Disqus for comments</del> have added Disqus, and maybe some
social media buttons...

The resume will contain things about my work history and education. Pretty
basic stuff.

My contact page will give you all ways to get a hold of me if you want to say
"Hello" or anything at all.

The About page may be a minor autobiography, I am not quite sure, it may get removed.

The Craft page will contain some of my thoughts about various cool things that
interest me.

The Projects page will describe Open Source projects that I have contributed to
and the people that are involved in it.

Until I get this all done, I will continue to let you all know about the things
that I am doing with it.

If you have any suggestions for me, let me know at isaac@__DOMAIN__.
