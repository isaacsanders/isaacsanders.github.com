title: My First CodeMash
---

All I can say is "Wow!" I had a great time at CodeMash v2.0.1.2 and I can't
wait for next year! It was filled with great conversation, wonderful fellowship
and learning. I would like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity
to volunteer. It is also thanks to Todd Kaufman and Greg Malcolm for helping to
transport me to and from the conference.

##Conversations

I had many opportunities to listen to people at CodeMash. These are some of my
favorite memories. I enjoyed speaking with Jen Myers about her work at
Relevance, GirlDevelopIt Columbus, and movies we both enjoy. I was enthralled by
the interesting recollections by Corey Haines and Leon Gersing. Meeting and
chatting with Justin Kohnen and Chris Woodruff on Tuesday night was another fun
time. On my last day of CodeMash, I had a great conversation with one of my
mentors, Michael "Doc" Norton of LeanDog. I am feeling even more excited about
starting there next week now. I can't wait for an opportunity to chat with
more of the people in our community at length.

##Fellowship

Besides the many conversations, I was able to spend some quality time with
people in our community. I had a great time playing Chrononauts with the
Quarantos and others, then playing some Texas Hold'em with Mike Lutton and Jim
Towne, all during Wednesday evening. On Thursday, I enjoyed playing an expanded
game of Settlers of Catan with Jennifer, Tim, Wes, Duane, Bruce, Glenn, Kevin
and Dean. I can't wait to play with all of them again next year.

##Learning

I enjoyed various talks by Jim Weirich on writing better (ruby) code, learning
about Clojure through fairytale with Carin Meier, understanding parts of going
independent with Michael Eaton, all of the lightning talks, hosted by Corey
Haines, a most suitable talk by the capable Gary Bernhardt and a wonderful time
in the open spaces.

##Code Retreat and Moving

Tomorrow I will venture north to the land of Cleve to spend some more time in
fellowship at the LeanDog hangar, then I will be spending the next week
preparing for my move to Cleveland to start working at the same building. I
can't wait to meet all of the intelligent members of the Cleveland dev community
and the I hope to learn all I can.
