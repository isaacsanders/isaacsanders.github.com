I just release v0.0.2 of Chemistry, a gem that will act as a Chemistry toolkit.

##Purpose

I was at PyOhio last weekend and just got back from Steel City Ruby Conf this
weekend and I was inspired by talks at both to work on something more
scientific. I will be entering as a Freshman at Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology in the Fall, and I will have to take a Chemistry course at some
point, so I figured that it may be something that will help me in my studies.

Also, I enjoy thinking about science, and I enjoy programming, so why not
combine the two in an OSS contribution.

##Scope

I want this gem to be able to perform many chemical operations, such as
balancing chemical equations, molality and molarity, equation parsing, and much
more.

If there are any suggestions for features, I would love to discuss them in the
[GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/isaacsanders/chemistry/issues).

##Contributing

Right now, there are no elements defined, but I have written a DSL for
defining them.

If you are interested in contributing, I would love help listing elements.
