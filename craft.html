title: My Story of Craftsmanship

<h1>Software Craftsmanship</h1>
<p>
  Software Craftsmanship is an idea that was first presented to me by my mentor,
  <a href="http://twitter.com/objo">Joe O'Brien</a>. The idea was interesting to
  me, and during my time at <a href="http://edgecase.com">EdgeCase</a> I learned
  more about the practice from their numerous Artisans. At EdgeCase, I read the book
  <a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/">Apprenticeship Patterns</a>
  by <a href="http://redsquirrel.com/dave/">Dave Hoover</a> and
  <a href="http://www.oshineye.com"/>Ade Oshineye</a>, among others, and I
  blogged about my thoughts and reflections. You can find the posts from that
  blog on this website now.

<h1>Test Driven Development</h1>
<p>
  When I first used Test Driven Development (TDD), it felt weird. The idea of
  testing to write code seemed odd to me. However, after getting into the flow
  of it, I began to understand and appreciate it. It was easier to get started
  when I built the API before having to build the code around it. At this point,
  I still have a lot to learn about testing, but it is something I am interested
  in. I will add more as I discover.

<h1>Agile Method</h1>
<p>
  Agile has a lot of mixed feelings around it, for me, and it seems for the
  community. I think it has a lot of great aspects, but I don't think I have
  ever been on a conventional Agile project. I expect this portion of the page
  to change significantly.

<h1>Mentors</h1>
<p>
  I would like to use this space to thank the wonderful people that have helped
  mentor me in my journey so far, and those who I will meet in the future. I
  can't begin to express how drastically you have all blessed my life.
