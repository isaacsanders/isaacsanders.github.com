<article id='diaspora'>
  <h1>Diaspora</h1>
  <p>
    Diaspora is an open source social network.
    My contribution to this was small, but it was my first contribution.
    I hope the Diaspora project has continued success, and I hope to
    contribute again someday.

<article id='flamethrower'>
  <h1>Flamethrower</h1>
  <p>
    Simple node.js app to monitor a Campfire room and relay each post to another
    HTTP endpoint (from the repository's Github).
  </p>
  <p>
    I helped to convert Flamethrower from using the user's name as the data posted
    to using the user's Campfire ID. I also implemented support for TextMessages
    and PasteMessages (descriptions are available on
    <a href="http://developer.37signals.com/campfire/">37signals' developer site</a>).

<article id='githubris'>
  <h1>Githubris</h1>
  <p>
    Githubris is a Ruby wrapper around the GitHub v3 API. Its purpose is to
    provide a familiar DSL for interacting with the API.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am the author of Githubris, along with object design assistance from Zee
    Spencer.
