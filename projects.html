<h1>Diaspora</h1>
<p>
  Diaspora is an open source social network.
  My contribution to this was small, but it was my first contribution.
  I hope the Diaspora project has continued success, and I hope to
  contribute again someday.

<h1>Flamethrower</h1>
<p>
  Simple node.js app to monitor a Campfire room and relay each post to another
  HTTP endpoint (from the repository's Github).
</p>
<p>
  I helped to convert Flamethrower from using the user's name as the data posted
  to using the user's Campfire ID. I also implemented support for TextMessages
  and PasteMessages (descriptions are available on
  <a href="http://developer.37signals.com/campfire/">37signals' developer site</a>).
