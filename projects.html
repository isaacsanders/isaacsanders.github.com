<article id='diaspora'>
  <h1>Diaspora</h1>
  <p>
    Diaspora is an open source social network.
    My contribution to this was small, but it was my first contribution.

    contribute again someday.

<article id='flamethrower'>
  <h1>Flamethrower</h1>
  <p>
    Simple node.js app to monitor a Campfire room and relay each post to another
    HTTP endpoint (from the repository's Github).
  </p>
  <p>
    I helped to convert Flamethrower from using the user's name as the data posted
    to using the user's Campfire ID. I also implemented support for TextMessages
    and PasteMessages (descriptions are available on
    <a href="http://developer.37signals.com/campfire/">37signals' developer site</a>).

    provide a familiar DSL for interacting with the API.

    I am the author of Githubris, along with object design assistance from Zee
    Spencer.

<article id='httparty'>
  <h1>HTTParty</h1>
  <p>
    HTTParty is an HTTP client library that provides a simple way to access
    JSON, XML, HTML, and YAML HTTP APIs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I added the HTTP method PATCH to HTTParty, as part of my work on Githubris.

<article id='nulldb'>
  <h1>NullDB</h1>
  <p>
    NullDB is the Null Object pattern as applied to ActiveRecord database
    adapters. It is a database backend that translates database interactions
    into no-ops. Using NullDB enables you to test your model business logic -
    including after_save hooks - without ever touching a real database.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have recently joined the NullDB team. I am excited to work with the team
    and take this project into the future!
